# OpenGl Tutorial

This repository contains the code I wrote while following a youtube OpenGL tutorial that can be found over here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkiKgQRiMRU

This project depends on mingw32.

The project is designed to be compiled on windows and contains the following binary dependencies:

* GLEW
* SDL2

To compile, simply run `compile.bat` from the root directory of the project.
