# OpenGl Tutorial

This repository contains the code I wrote while following a youtube OpenGL tutorial that can be found over here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkiKgQRiMRU

This project depends on mingw32.

The project is designed to be compiled on windows and contains the following binary dependencies:

* GLEW
* SDL2
* Windows pthread port.

To compile, simply run `make` from the root directory of the project.
If you are using Windows / MinGW, you most probably have the `mingw32-make.exe` which you can alias to `make`.

You can run the program by double clicking `bin/main.exe`.
